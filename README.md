## Spreading Hacktoberfest Love

This project started as a way to show Matt some love for Hacktoberfest back in 2020, but has since evolved to express love for all of the folks who make Hacktoberfest so amazing.

The bot will only spread love within the `sharing-the-love` channel, and is heavily rate-limited to avoid spam.

## Providing Useful Information

The bot now has a tag system, which allows for FAQ-like responses to quickly respond to common questions.

To use the tag system, type `hf.<name>` where `<name>` is replaced by the name of the tag you want to send. To view available tags, type `hf.--list`.
